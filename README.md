# Enigma Simulator

This repository contains my implementation of an Enigma machine simulator. The Enigma machine was a complex cipher device utilized by the Germans in WWII for encoding and decoding secret messages. This project aims to mimic the behavior of that machine where users can provide the initial settings and input to be encoded or decoded.

The full spec for this project can be found here: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp22/materials/proj/proj1/index.html
